# **App Name**: HarvestAI

## Core Features:

- Image Input: Allow the user to upload an image from their gallery or take a new photo using their device's camera.
- Ripeness Analysis: Use a pre-trained AI model to analyze the image and determine the ripeness/maturity level of the cannabis plant.
- Result Display: Display the analysis results, including the predicted harvest time (e.g., "Ready to harvest in 1 week").
- Recommendations: Provide additional information and recommendations based on the AI analysis, such as adjusting lighting or nutrients. The LLM will act as a tool to choose appropriate recommendations.

- Secondary color: Earthy brown (#795548) to ground the design.
- Accent: Gold (#FFC107) to highlight important information and the optimal harvest time.
